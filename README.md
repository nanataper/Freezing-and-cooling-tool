Calculating what type of freezers are needed for the process & freezing and cooling details accoring to the product.

Linde freezers meet the needs of a variety of applications. Modern freezer designs use the latest control programs to increase efficiency while meeting stringent hygiene standards.
Cryogenic freezing of food with liquid nitrogen (LIN) and carbon dioxide (LIC) is a well-established practice that relies on those gases’ extreme cold temperatures (–196°C or –320°F, in the case of liquid nitrogen) as they come into contact with food. In the case of liquid carbon dioxide, snow forms when the liquid expands. The snow then vaporises on the product.
The CRYOLINE® family of food chilling equipment meets these modern requirements. To see what will work best for you, please review the information contained in the specific food product or freezer pages.
